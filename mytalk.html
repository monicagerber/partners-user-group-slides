# This talk

1. Isolated data scientists&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;
2. Jumping into the R community (w/ links to rstudio::conf)
3. My shiny app

&gt; How can isolated data scientists at Partners address the challenges and take advantages of the opportunities of these roles?

# The landscape

Many "isolated data scientists" at Partners.

### My analysis:

* Many opportunities
* Great challenges may overwhelm these opportunities

&lt;img src="images/lonely-hiker.jpg" style="width: 400px;"/&gt;

---

# Problem

* Training is focused on theoretical topics (how to do a t-test, etc.)
* Not enough focus on the *practice* of being a data scientist
* When you're on you're own, logistical challenges can be really tough

&lt;img src="images/desk-thinking.jpg" style="width: 500px;"/&gt;

---

# Options

1. Remain in isolation. Use SAS.
2. Jump into R community and focus on the *practice* of being a data scientist.
    + Build what you need
    + Organize your workflow
    + Find joy in what you do
    + Be productive while learning new things

No need to wait

Just get your idea out there

# Balance productivity and learning

&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;

* A lot to learn from outside your discipline
* With Shiny, we're stepping more into a new type of role

# getting to work with Shiny

---

# My first app

* An app to visualize economic hardship in Massachusetts based on methodology from Brookings Institution's analysis of [Chicago](https://greatcities.uic.edu/2017/10/11/mapping-the-hardship-index-the-geography-of-poverty-in-san-antonio-and-chicago/) neighborhoods.
* Center for Community Health Improvement works in low income neighborhoods where economic instability contributes to poor health outcomes.

---

# My top logistical challenges

### Marginality

* Data science is tangential to the core work. 
* Community health workers and managers are most concerned about addressing the immediate problems of patients. Leaders are often focused on finding support for the the community health work.

### Mystery

* People aren't sure exactly what it is that data scientists do.
* What is Shiny? What is R? Can you help me with my spreadsheet?


### Misalignment 

* Poor placement of data scientists.
* At MGH, people are working many different health centers and offices.

# Marginality -&gt; user stories

&gt; User stories are a way to describing the work that puts the focus on the value to the end user.

Before:

I am going to recalculate the Chicago hardship index using 2015 census data to show how economic hardship varies across Massachusetts and visualize it with a choropleth map.

As a ____, I need to ____, so that I can ____.


After: As an executive at MGH, I need to build a case for CCHI, so that I can find donors to support our work.

# Mystery -&gt; vertical slicing

&gt; Maximize the work not done.

&gt; Find the thinnest vertical slice.

* Instead of spending hours and hours on something, and then presenting this to the user (the whole cake), the idea is to find the thinnest vertical slice. 
    + Quickly get from the thinnest layer to the top
    + Narrow the scope

  
* Make use of all the time you spend on data collection and manipulation.

# Ideas for vertical slicing with shiny

* Build 1 page at a time
* Use flexdashboards
* Don't worry if it's not pretty
* Don't worry if you don't do everything the "right" way 

---

# Misalignment -&gt; Stakeholder reviews

* Review the vertical slices.
* What do you want to spend time on vs. what is creating value?

# Key takeaways

* R is a great way to address the challenges of isolation.
* Use it because it's fun.
* Tons of online and offline communities to support you.
* Learning is hard. Be kind to yourself &amp; have compassion for others.
